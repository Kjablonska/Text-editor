# Text editor
Simple text editor developed using vanilla JS and Node.js on backend side.

# Description
The aim of this project is to develop a simple text editor which supports bolding, italics and bullet points.  
The text is stored as a JSON file in assetes/text.json.  
It is possible to save the text.  
The app does not support Internet Explorer, as it uses the fetch api. If the user's browser is IE, information on browser support is displayed.
